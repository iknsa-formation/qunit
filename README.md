## Qunit Tutorial

### Getting started
```
# tag 0.1.0
git checkout 0.1.0
```

There is a function nbCars which takes a number that should only be positve and returns a boolean in our app.js.

To test this function we will submit different +ve and -ve values to the function and see if it does return what is expected

### Assertions
```
# tag 0.2.0
git checkout 0.2.0
```
Here we are going to test some assertions. We'll keep it simple, is 1 = 1.

As you can see there can be different ways to check if 1 is actually equal to 1 since there can be type checking also

```
# tag 0.2.1
git checkout 0.2.1
```
Here we are going to test some assertions on different objects containing the same values.

What we want to achieve is to check if 2 different objects contains the same properties and values.
